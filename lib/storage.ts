/**
 * Recommended storage solution for production:
 *
 * For a blockchain-based application like AffidBlock, we recommend using:
 *
 * 1. AWS S3 or similar cloud storage for temporary storage of documents and images
 * 2. IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for permanent, decentralized storage of verified documents
 *
 * The workflow would be:
 * 1. Upload ID card images and documents to S3 during registration/application
 * 2. Once an affidavit is verified and approved, store the final document on IPFS
 * 3. Store the IPFS hash on the blockchain for immutable verification
 *
 * This provides both the convenience of traditional cloud storage and the
 * permanence and tamper-proof nature of decentralized storage.
